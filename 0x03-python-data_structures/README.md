## Definitions:

### Data structures are “containers” that organize and group data according to type. The basic Python data structures in Python include list, set, tuples, and dictionary.

### Lists are used to store data of different data types in a sequential manner. There are addresses assigned to every element of the list, which is called as Index.

### Tuples are the same as lists are with the exception that the data once entered into the tuple cannot be changed no matter what.
